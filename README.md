Workbench Annotation
====================

About this module
-----------------
Workbench Annotation allows you to annotate and review Entities that are moderated with Workbench Moderation.

In addition to adding basic annotations, you can also add Important annotations that block Workbench Moderation States.
Until all Important annotations are resolved, the Entity can not move forward with your workflow. This is critical for
reviewers who want to take a "red pen" to an Entity and ensure that their annotation is resolved.

More details to follow after the module gets an official Drupal.org Project page.
